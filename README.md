# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Yuanhang Huang


## Project Reflection

### 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
I spent approximately 2 weeks working on this assignment.

### 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am most satisfied with the overall functionality of the travel tracking app that I have completed. 
It manages travel data successfully and performs various operations efficiently.

### 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am least satisfied with some of the minor details in my code and the user interface. There are a few areas 
that could have been improved for a more polished user experience.

### 4. What worked well in your development process?
The use of loops and iteration in my code worked well, allowing me to efficiently process and manipulate data. 
Additionally, the layout and structure of my classes helped in organizing the code.
I also use Git and GitHub for version control. It enables collaboration, tracking changes, and reverting to previous 
versions when necessary.

### 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
In future projects, I need to pay more attention to the finer details of user interface design and layout. 
Also, I should spend more time on code optimization to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible.
- **Project Planning**: More comprehensive project planning at the outset, including detailed specifications 
and clear milestones, could help prevent scope creep and enhance project management.

- **User Interface Design**: Investing more time in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design would
result in a more visually appealing and user-friendly application.

- **Code Optimization**: While the code is functional, further optimization for performance and efficiency should 
be considered, especially if the application is expected to handle larger datasets.

- **Error Handling**: Enhancing error handling and providing informative error messages to users would improve the 
overall user experience and troubleshooting process.

### 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I primarily used the content from my university course at JCU and the practical exercises to learn and practice 
Python programming. Additionally, I referred to online resources and documentation for specific Python libraries 
and frameworks when needed.
- **University Course Content**: I relied heavily on the course materials and lectures provided by JCU. The course 
content provided me with a solid foundation in Python programming and object-oriented concepts, which 
was essential for this project.

- **Practical Exercises**: The practical exercises provided in the course were invaluable. They allowed me to 
practice coding, implement algorithms, and understand core concepts in a hands-on manner.

- **Online Documentation**: I often refer to official Python documentation and libraries, such as the Python 
Standard Library documentation, Flask documentation, and other related packages. This helps me understand 
the features, methods, and usage of various Python modules and libraries.

- **Online tutorials**: I turn to online tutorials when I'm faced with a specific problem. These resources help 
me find solutions to specific coding problems and learn about best practices.

### 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
One of the main challenges I faced was dealing with bugs and logic issues in my code. I spent a significant 
amount of time debugging and testing to identify and resolve these issues. I also sought help from my peers 
when I encountered particularly challenging problems.

### 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
I found that using classes in my code improved its organization and readability. It allowed me to 
encapsulate data and behavior, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. Object-oriented 
programming principles helped in creating a cleaner and more structured codebase.
